# Introduction

Tsngo aims to implement the game logic of LinkedIn's Tango without any dependencies, allowing everyone to use it in their own projects with ease, such as implementing their own game interfaces and experimenting AI agent's ability in solving the puzzles.

For those who just want to play the game, you can following the instruction on [README](https://github.com/travistang/tsngo/blob/main/README.md).

## But why?

Well, if you have played the actual game, you probably know that you are only allowed to solve one puzzle per day. I want to solve more puzzles, that's why I created my own and now I can play with it all day ðŸ˜„

Also this is a good programming practice as there are quite some problems I faced while implementing it:

- How is a puzzle created?
- How do I solve the puzzle programmatically?
- How are the boards validated?
- How should I structure my code?
- ...

Having a package like this would also allow me to build more projects on top of that. You will probably see more related projects from me in the following days.
